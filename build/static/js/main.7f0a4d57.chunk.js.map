I am just as curious as \n                      I use to be, but I just need to dedicate time to thinking about and documenting my thoughts - and it makes me really happy when I do. :)\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>\n                      I'm currently based in San Francisco, California.

Bill Gates does a really great job of describing the challenges our world will face if developed countries aren’t able to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050. He highlights action steps that need to be taken and technologies currently in development or that need to be invented in order to achieve this ambitious goal of carbon-zero. Bill Gates also is objectively a really great writer. Even the way he starts his book is quite memorable. He says, “There are two numbers you need to know about climate change. The first is 51 billion. The other is zero. Fifty-one billion is how many tons of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere every year...This is where we are today. Zero is what we need to aim for” (3). 51 billion tons serves as a goal of a quantity we want to reduce, and Gates shows us how we can do this. This book not only conveys the sense of urgency we should all feel about the looming issue of climate change, but Gates also instills in the readers a sense of optimism that we will be able to avoid a climate disaster if we take action -- in technology, policy, and our daily lives -- today.\n                  </p>\n                  <h3 class = {style.SubHeading}> \n                  1. WHY DO WE NEED TO REACH CARBON-ZERO BY 2050?\n                  </h3>\n                  <p>\n                  Greenhouse gases absorb and trap heat, causing the average surface temperature of the earth to go up. (1/5th of CO2 emitted today will persist in the atmosphere for 10,000 years. [18]\n                  They work the same way a greenhouse works. Example of a car sitting in the sun: windshield lets the sunlight in, then traps some of that energy. Thus why the car gets much hotter on the inside than the outside. [22, 23]\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                  How does a hotter climate affect our planet?\n                  <ol>\n                    <li>There will be more frequent and destructive wildfires. Warm air absorbs moisture from plants and soil, leaving everything more prone to burning (ie. dry wood vs. damp wood).</li>\n                    <li>Sea levels will go up due to the polar ice melting and seawater expanding (since 90% ofthe planet’s heat will be absorbed by oceans). Rising sea levels will be worse for the poorest people in the world who do not have the infrastructure to defend against resulting natural disasters. (ie. Bangladesh, a poor country that’s making good progress on the path out of poverty, mostly sits in low-lying flood-prone river deltas. “Thanks to cyclones, storm surges, and river floods, it is now common for 20-30% of Bangladesh to be underwater, wiping out crops and homes and killing people throughout the country.” [29])</li>\n                    <li>Plants and animals are being affected. “According to research cited by the IPCC, a rise of 2oC would cut the geographic range of vertebrates by 8 percent, plants by 16 percent, and insects by 18 percent.” [29].</li>\n                  </ol>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                    Despite the remaining scientific uncertainties and many other effects of climate change, here are two things we can do about it: [35]\n                    <ol>\n                      <li>Adaptation: minimize the impact of the changes that are already here and that we know are coming. “Gates foundation is funding a lot of research into new varieties of crops that tolerate droughts and floods that will be more frequent and severe in coming decades.”</li>\n                      <li>Mitigation: ways to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. “To have any hope of staving off disaster, the world’s biggest emitters — the richest countries — have to get to net-zero emissions by 2050.”</li>\n                    </ol>\n                  </p>\n\n                  <h3 class = {style.SubHeading}>\n                  2.

They are so pervasive that it can be hard to grasp all the ways in which they touch our lives. Did you brush your teeth this morning? The toothbrush probably contains plastic, which is made from petroleum, a fossil fuel. If you ate breakfast, the grains in your cereal were grown with fertilizer, which releases greenhouse gases when it’s made. Take oil as just one example: The world uses more than 4 billion gallons every day. There’s a very good reason why fossil fuels are everywhere: They’re so inexpensive. Oil is cheaper than a soft drink.”\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                  Problems with policies:\n                    <ol>\n                      <li>Our laws and regulations are outdated.</li>\n                      <li>Our approach to climate and energy keeps changing with the election cycle [48].</li>\n                      <li>Global cooperation is difficult.

Good approximations for power (watts per day): Whenever you hear “kilowatt”, think “house.” “Gigawatt,” think “city.” A hundred or more gigawatts, think “big country.” The US consumes about 1,000 gigawatts per day. [57]</li>\n                        <li>How Much Space Do You Need? Some power sources take up more room than others. This matters for the obvious reason that space is limited.

Studies show that\n                          depending on where it’s built, a dam can actually be a worse emitter than coal for 50 - 100 years before it makes up for all the methane it’s responsible for.\n                          </li>\n                          <li>Amount of electricity generated from a dam depends on the season, because you’re relying on rain-fed streams and rivers.</li>\n                          <li>Hydropower is immobile. You have to build dams where the rivers are.</li>\n                      </ul>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                  Over time, electricity has become extraordinarily cheap. One study found that it was at least 200 times more affordable in 2000 than in 1900. Today, the U.S. spends only 2% of its GDP on electricity (super low number considering how much we rely on it). [70]\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>Fossil Fuels:</h5>\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Cheap. Their prices don’t factor in the true cost of climate change (the economic damage they inflict by making the planet warmer), and this makes it harder for clean energy sources to compete with them. </li>\n                    <li>Some regions of the world don’t have decent renewable resources. To get close to 100% renewable, we’d have to move lots of clean energy from where it’s made. This would require building transmission lines (costly + time-consuming), especially for crossing national borders.</li>\n                    <ul>\n                      <li>More power lines we install, the more the price of power goes up.</li>\n                      <li>Transmission and distribution are responsible for more than 1⁄3 the final cost of electricity. (think of transmission as the freeway and distribution as the local road. We use high-voltage transmission lines to deliver electricity from the power plant to the city. Then, the electricity goes into the local, lower-voltage distribution system -- which are the power lines we see in our neighborhood.) </li>\n                    </ul>\n                  </ul>\n\n                  <h5>Solar & Wind:</h5>\n\n                  <h4>3.2/ HOW WE MAKE THINGS</h4>\n                  <h4>3.3/ AGRICULTURE</h4>\n                  <h4>3.4/ TRANSPORTATION</h4>\n                  <h4>3.5/ HEATING & COOLING</h4>\n                  <h4>3.6/ SUMMARY + OTHERS</h4>\n\n\n                </div>             \n\n            </div>\n\n        </section>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default HowToAvoidAClimateDisaster\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Navbar from '../Navbar'\nimport '../styles/Styles.css'\nimport style from '../styles/thoughts.module.css'\n\n\nconst CapacitiveTouch = () => {\n    return (\n        <section className='ideas'>\n            <Navbar/>\n            <div className=\"thoughts\"> \n                <div className=\"cards title\">\n                  <h1 class = {style.Layout}>Capacitive Touch</h1>\n                  <br></br>\n                </div>\n                \n                <div class = {style.CapTouchSlide}>\n                  <img src=\"/capacitive-touch/capacitive-touch_self-cap.png\" alt=\"Self Capacitance\" class = {style.CapTouchImage}/>\n                  <br></br>\n                  <img src=\"/capacitive-touch/capacitive-touch_mutual-cap.png\" alt=\"Self Capacitance\" class = {style.CapTouchImage}/>\n                </div>\n                \n            </div>\n\n        </section>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default CapacitiveTouch\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { HashRouter as Router,Routes,Route } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Bookshelf from './components/Bookshelf';\nimport Thoughts from './components/Thoughts';\nimport Home from './components/Home';\nimport AboutMe from './components/AboutMe';\nimport Scratchpad from './components/Scratchpad';\nimport HowToAvoidAClimateDisaster from './components/books/HowToAvoidAClimateDisaster'; /* Make this more scalable*/\nimport CapacitiveTouch from './components/thoughts/capacitive-touch';\n\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Router>\n    <Routes>\n      <Route path='/' element={<Home/>}/>\n      <Route path='/aboutme' element={<AboutMe/>}/>\n      <Route path='/bookshelf' element={<Bookshelf/>}/>\n        <Route path='/bookshelf/how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster' element={<HowToAvoidAClimateDisaster/>}/>\n      <Route path='/thoughts' element={<Thoughts/>}/>\n        <Route path='/thoughts/capacitive-touch' element={<CapacitiveTouch/>}/>\n      <Route path='/scratchpad' element={<Scratchpad/>}/>\n    </Routes>\n  </Router>,\n\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
