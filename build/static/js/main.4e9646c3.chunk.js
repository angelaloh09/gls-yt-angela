Bill Gates also is objectively a really great writer. Even the way he starts his book is quite memorable. He says, \u201cThere are two numbers you need to know about climate change. The first is 51 billion. The other is zero. Fifty-one billion is how many tons of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere every year...This is where we are today. Zero is what we need to aim for\u201d (3). 51 billion tons serves as a goal of a quantity we want to reduce, and Gates shows us how we can do this.
