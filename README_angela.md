4.25.2024: 
Changes Made: 
- Able to deploy website with a github URL. Debugged issue where the wrong index file was being build & deployed. 
- Fixed the different text colors for nav bar. 
- Got started with getting a custom domain name linked. 

Next Time: 
- Get custom domain name up and running! 
- Finish adding book report for Climate Disaster
- Figure out why nav bar transition covers entire screen. 

4.23.2024: 
Changes Made: 
- Made sure that the nav bar elements align for smaller windows. 
- Color of the nav bar is correct 
- Close Icon is in a fixed position in the upper right hand corner.

Next Time: 
- Figure out why the nav bar transition covers the entire screen (~50em window size)

4.10.2024: 
Changes Made: 
- I forget :0 

Next Time; 
- Figure out how to scale the menu in a better way (maybe get rid of the side swipe animation!)

4.9.2024: 
Changes Made: 
  - With the help of arvid, I have learned tables and divs and using cmd-option-i in the chrome debugging to
    inspect items! I also now understand the difference between margin vs. padding, as well as 
    setting max widths for divs! This has helped because when I shrink the window, the text for bookshelf 
    and thoughts wrap around! 
  - I also learned how to use cursor to a greater potential!! Especially co-pilot ++! 
  - You can use :hover on classes that you define yourself! 
  - .ts is typescript and .js is javascript. Typescript is statically typed vs. Javascript is dynamically
    typed. Feels kind of like a java vs. python type of thing! 
Next Time: 
  - Fix the layout of Scratchpad.js. 
  - Add markdown files for one of the book-reports (ie. Climate book one!)

4.6.2024: 
Changes Made: 
  - Got rid of scratchpad.module.css file. Combined & abstracted the styling needed for scratchpad with thoughts & bookshelf layout. 
  - Able to combine different component types to have same styling asks. 
  - Changed Helvetica font to Monaco font. 
  - Learned how to use cmd K to insert code snippets! 
Next time: 
  - Figure out how to make the spacing for Thoughts & Bookshelf scalable. Probably by creating separate elements for date, content, and author, if that applies. 


4.4.2024: 
Used cursor for the first time! Very helpful! 
Changes Made:  
  - Added "Scratchpad.js" page as a commonplace book page. Perhaps rename the tabs in the future. 
  - Using a global styling sheet now - Styles.css instead of individual style sheets between Books, Thoughts, and Scratchpad. 
  - Learned and know how to use a .module.css file now! It's pretty cool because you can do localized styling this way. But I probably need to change it up for 
    scratchpad, since I need those styles applied to every single link. 
  - Made my hyperlinks turn purple when the mouse hovers over it! 
  - Changed color of navbar and homepage tab links. maybe I'll like it black later on. 
Next time:
  - Figure out how to make the spacing for Thoughts & Bookshelf scalable. Probably by creating separate elements for date, content, and author, if that applies. 
  - If time holds, figure out who to change the default Helvetica font.
